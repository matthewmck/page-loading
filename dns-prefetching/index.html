    <h1>HTML dns-prefetch and preconnect attribute</h1>
    <h2>DNS Prefetch</h2>
    <p>This notifies the client that there are assets we’ll need later from a specific URL so the browser can resolve
        the DNS as quickly as possible. Then, when we request a file from it, we’ll no longer have to wait for the DNS
        lookup.</p>

    <h2>Preconnect</h2>
    <p>Much like the DNS prefetch method, preconnect will resolve the DNS but it will also make the TCP handshake, and
        optional TLS negotiation. It can be used like this</p>
    <h2>Best practices</h2>
    dns-prefetch is only effective for DNS lookups on cross-origin domains, so avoid using it to point to your
    site or domain. This is because the IP behind your site’s domain will have already been resolved by the time
    the browser sees the hint.

    <p>Bear in mind that while
        preconnect is pretty cheap, it can still take up valuable CPU time, particularly on secure
        connections. This is especially bad if the connection isn’t used within 10 seconds, as the browser closes it,
        wasting all of that early connection work.</p>
    <p>In general, try to use
        preload wherever you can, as it’s a more comprehensive performance tweak, but do keep preconnect in
        your toolbelt for the edge cases.</p>
    <p>You want to speed up more than 4-6 domains. It’s not recommended to use preconnect with more than 4-6 domains, as
        opening and keeping a connection is an expensive
        operation. dns-prefetch is more lightweight, so use it for other third-party domains
        if you want to speed them up too.</p>
